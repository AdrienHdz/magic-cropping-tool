**What is Magic Cropping Tool?**

Hello! **Magic Cropping Tool** is a small open source project created by me: [Adrien Hernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrienhernandez/). I'm a machine learning engineering specialist and Entrepreneur.
This web app aims at showcasing my skills in **AI, software development and deployment on Cloud Platforms**.
It is not intended to be a commercial product ever. The goal of this project is simply to demonstrate the potential of AI in practical applications and to offer users a way to interact with an AI model for picture cropping. While it is not a comprehensive solution, it offers an experience for thoses interested in exploring the capabilities of AI!

**Licensing**
The artificial intelligence model utilized on this website in production is based on the exceptional work of [Twitter Research](https://github.com/twitter-research/image-crop-analysis).
The html and css layout of this website draws inspiration from the [Complete Angular Developer in 2023](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-angular/) course from ZTM, which I completed and found to be amazing.
